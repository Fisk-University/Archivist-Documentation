# üìÉ Rosenwald Project: Archivist Documentation

This repository helps **archivists, librarians, and digital humanities professionals** at HBCUs and similar institutions replicate the digital archive built at Fisk University for the **Julius Rosenwald Fund** collection. It contains clear, non-technical guidance on how to set up, configure, and launch your own Omeka S-based site with minimal overhead and long-term sustainability.

> ‚ú® This is the public-friendly version of our internal developer documentation. If you're a developer, please request access to the private repo for system architecture and credentials.

## üìÜ About the Rosenwald Project

The Rosenwald Project is a Mellon Foundation-funded initiative that digitizes the history of **Julius Rosenwald**, a philanthropist who helped fund thousands of schools for African Americans in the early 20th century. 

Fisk University launched this digital archive to preserve and share Rosenwald-related documents with the world. Just as importantly, we documented every step to help **other HBCUs and cultural memory institutions** replicate this effort with low cost and little technical burden.

This guide is part of our mission to make digital preservation more accessible and sustainable across the archival community.

## üìÅ Why We Chose Omeka S

[Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) is a free and open-source content management system built for digital collections. It's widely used by universities, archives, and museums.

We chose it because:
- It's **designed for metadata-rich archives**
- Supports **modular themes and plugins**
- Has a large user community and solid documentation
- Requires **no licensing fees**

With the right modules and infrastructure, Omeka S offers enterprise power with a low learning curve.

## üöß Reducing Technical and Cost Overhead

We avoided vendor lock-in and kept costs low using:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** infrastructure (In our case, was more cost effective than Azure):
  - EC2: open-source hosting
  - RDS: managed MySQL database
  - S3: cloud media storage
  - IAM: secure access roles
  - Route 53: subdomain management
- **Omeka S**: free and modular, no proprietary CMS required
- **Open-source plugins**: no license fees

For universities with limited IT support, AWS provides scalable hosting that can be documented and replicated with minimal hands-on maintenance.
