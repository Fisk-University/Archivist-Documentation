# customVocabularySample

This folder contains sample custom vocabularies for use with [Omeka-S](https://omeka.org/s/), designed to help archivists and librarians enhance metadata precision and consistency in their digital collections.

## Purpose

Archivists often need vocabularies tailored to specific institutions, communities, metadata properties or collection types. This folder provides example files as a starting point to help users define their own controlled vocabularies in Omeka-S using the proper structure and format.

By using these examples as a guide, archivists can create their own RDF/JSON-LD vocabularies to support custom metadata fields, controlled term lists, or local cataloging practices.

## Customizing Your Vocabulary

Each sample file follows the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format. You can:
- Edit or replace term labels and URIs.
- Add or remove fields relevant to your collection.
- Include descriptions, comments, or examples for each term.

We recommend validating any modified files before importing them into your Omeka-S instance.
